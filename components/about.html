      <p class="about__text">
        Systemic Constellations is a powerful, evidence-based therapeutic
        approach that reveals and resolves hidden patterns within families,
        organizations, and relationships. By creating a visual representation of
        your system, we uncover limiting beliefs and unconscious dynamics that
        may be holding you back.

        Through this work, clients gain awareness, heal old patterns, and
        experience deep shifts in perspective and direction.
